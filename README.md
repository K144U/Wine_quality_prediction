# Wine Quality Prediction Machine Learning Model

Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction repository! This project provides a machine learning model designed to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. Whether you're a wine enthusiast, a sommelier, or a researcher in the wine industry, this model can help you assess and classify wine quality more effectively.

## Objective

The primary objective of this machine learning model is to predict the quality of wine samples based on their chemical composition. By analyzing features such as acidity, pH level, alcohol content, and more, the model aims to provide accurate predictions of wine quality.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing samples of red and white wines, along with their respective quality ratings. The dataset includes features such as:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol

## Model Training

The machine learning model is trained using various algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Gradient Boosting. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

## Usage

To use the Wine Quality Prediction model:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.
3. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
4. Run the provided Python script to load the trained model and make predictions on new wine samples.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques may also be employed to assess the model's robustness and generalization ability.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the model, optimizing performance, or adding new features, feel free to submit a pull request.
